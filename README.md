# Supergod-Engine
This is a game engine I am working on. It used to be in C# and on BitBucket, but I decided to switch to GitHub and C++.

The reason I switched to GitHub is because it's easier to find the repository in a Google search if it's here.  
The reason I switched to C++ is that managing memory, while it was possible with C#, was EXTREMELY hard. Here it's much simpler. Also, the main reason I used C# in the first place is reflection, but since I will only use reflection in the tools, I can make the engine in C++ and then a CLI wrapper.

Note that I am still not sure I will end up porting it to C++. I am just giving it a chance and I will choose if I want to continue making it in C++ later.
You can find the C# version on BitBucket here: https://bitbucket.org/oraviram/supergod-engine
